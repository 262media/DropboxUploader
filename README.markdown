Dropbox Uploader
================

Dropbox Uploader was a PHP class which could be used to upload files to [Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/), an online file synchronization and backup service.

It was developed before Dropbox released their API, and to work, it scraped their website.

You should really use their API now.
